# Lemonade API

We have designed a set of Lemonade-specific endpoints to enable client applications by extending the existing cloud-focused APIs (e.g., OpenAI). These extensions allow for a greater degree of UI/UX responsiveness in native applications by allowing applications to:

- Download models at setup time.
- Pre-load models at UI-loading-time, as opposed to completion-request time.
- Unload models to save memory space.
- Understand system resources and state to make dynamic choices.

## `POST /v1/pull`
<sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-fully_available-green)</sub>

Register and install models for use with Lemonade Server.

### Parameters

The Lemonade Server built-in model registry has a collection of model names that can be pulled and loaded. The `pull` endpoint can install any registered model, and it can also register-then-install any model available on Hugging Face.

**Common Parameters**

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `stream` | No | If `true`, returns Server-Sent Events (SSE) with download progress. Defaults to `false`. |
| `subscribe` | No | Only applies when `stream=true`. If `false`, the server starts a background model download job and returns a JSON snapshot immediately instead of keeping the HTTP response subscribed to SSE progress. Defaults to `true` for backwards compatibility. |

**Install a Model that is Already Registered**

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `model_name` | Yes | [Lemonade Server model name](https://lemonade-server.ai/models.html) to install. |

Example request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:13305/v1/pull \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model_name": "Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-CPU"
  }'
```

Response format:

```json
{
  "status":"success",
  "message":"Installed model: Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-CPU"
}
```

In case of an error, the status will be `error` and the message will contain the error message.

**Register and Install a Model**

Registration will place an entry for that model in the `user_models.json` file, which is located in the user's Lemonade cache (default: `~/.cache/lemonade`). Then, the model will be installed. Once the model is registered and installed, it will show up in the `models` endpoint alongside the built-in models and can be loaded.

The `recipe` field defines which software framework and device will be used to load and run the model.

> Note: the `model_name` for registering a new model must use the `user` namespace, to prevent collisions with built-in models. For example, `user.Phi-4-Mini-GGUF`.

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `model_name` | Yes | Namespaced [Lemonade Server model name](https://lemonade-server.ai/models.html) to register and install. |
| `checkpoint` | Yes | HuggingFace checkpoint to install. |
| `recipe` | Yes | Lemonade API recipe to load the model with. |
| `reasoning` | No | Whether the model is a reasoning model, like DeepSeek (default: false). Adds 'reasoning' label. |
| `vision` | No | Whether the model has vision capabilities for processing images (default: false). Adds 'vision' label. |
| `embedding` | No | Whether the model is an embedding model (default: false). Adds 'embeddings' label. |
| `reranking` | No | Whether the model is a reranking model (default: false). Adds 'reranking' label. |
| `mmproj` | No | Multimodal Projector (mmproj) file to use for vision models. |

Example request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:13305/v1/pull \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model_name": "user.Phi-4-Mini-GGUF",
    "checkpoint": "unsloth/Phi-4-mini-instruct-GGUF:Q4_K_M",
    "recipe": "llamacpp"
  }'
```

Response format:

```json
{
  "status":"success",
  "message":"Installed model: user.Phi-4-Mini-GGUF"
}
```

In case of an error, the status will be `error` and the message will contain the error message.

**Register an Omni-Model**

An omni collection is a collection type that bundles several already-registered models into a single entry that can be loaded, pulled, or deleted as a unit. Use `recipe: "collection.omni"` with a `components` array instead of `checkpoint`.

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `model_name` | Yes | Namespaced model name, e.g. `user.MyKit`. |
| `recipe` | Yes | Must be `"collection.omni"`. |
| `components` | Yes | Non-empty array of registered model names. Each entry must already exist in the registry (built-in or a previously registered `user.*` model). |

Components do not need to be downloaded already — any not-yet-downloaded components are pulled by the same call. Deleting the collection removes only the collection entry; components stay on disk.

Example request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:13305/v1/pull \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model_name": "user.MyKit",
    "recipe": "collection.omni",
    "components": ["Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF", "Whisper-Tiny", "SD-Turbo"]
  }'
```

### Streaming Response (stream=true)

When `stream=true`, the endpoint returns Server-Sent Events with real-time download progress:

```
event: progress
data: {"file":"model.gguf","file_index":1,"total_files":2,"bytes_downloaded":1073741824,"bytes_total":2684354560,"percent":40}

event: progress
data: {"file":"config.json","file_index":2,"total_files":2,"bytes_downloaded":1024,"bytes_total":1024,"percent":100}

event: complete
data: {"file_index":2,"total_files":2,"percent":100}
```

**Event Types:**

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `progress` | Sent during download with current file and byte progress |
| `complete` | Sent when all files are downloaded successfully |
| `error` | Sent if download fails, with `error` field containing the message |

### Server-owned download mode (`stream=true`, `subscribe=false`)

By default, `stream=true` keeps the `/v1/pull` HTTP response subscribed to Server-Sent Events until the download finishes. Clients that need download state to survive a renderer reload, tab close, or reconnect can also send `subscribe=false`.

When `stream=true` and `subscribe=false`, `/v1/pull` starts a server-owned model download job and returns a JSON snapshot immediately. The job continues on the server. Clients can poll [`GET /v1/downloads`](#get-v1downloads) to restore progress and can use [`POST /v1/downloads/control`](#post-v1downloadscontrol) to pause, cancel, or remove the job.

Example request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:13305/v1/pull \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model_name": "Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-CPU",
    "stream": true,
    "subscribe": false
  }'
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "id": "model:Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-CPU",
  "type": "model",
  "model_name": "Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-CPU",
  "status": "downloading",
  "running": true,
  "file": "",
  "file_index": 0,
  "total_files": 0,
  "bytes_downloaded": 0,
  "bytes_total": 0,
  "total_download_size": 0,
  "bytes_previously_downloaded": 0,
  "completed_files_bytes": 0,
  "cumulative_bytes_downloaded": 0,
  "overall_bytes_downloaded": 0,
  "percent": 0,
  "complete": false
}
```

## `GET /v1/downloads`
<sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-fully_available-green)</sub>

List server-owned model download jobs that were started with `POST /v1/pull` using `stream=true` and `subscribe=false`.

This endpoint is intended for clients that need to restore download-manager state after a reload or reconnect. Active, paused, cancelled, and errored jobs remain visible until the client removes them. Completed jobs remain visible briefly so clients can observe completion and refresh model state.

### Example request

```bash
curl http://localhost:13305/v1/downloads
```

### Response format

```json
[
  {
    "id": "model:Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-CPU",
    "type": "model",
    "model_name": "Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-CPU",
    "status": "downloading",
    "running": true,
    "file": "model.gguf",
    "file_index": 1,
    "total_files": 2,
    "bytes_downloaded": 1073741824,
    "bytes_total": 2684354560,
    "total_download_size": 2684355584,
    "bytes_previously_downloaded": 0,
    "completed_files_bytes": 0,
    "cumulative_bytes_downloaded": 1073741824,
    "overall_bytes_downloaded": 1073741824,
    "percent": 40,
    "complete": false
  }
]
```

### Download job fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `id` | Stable download id. Model downloads use `model:<model_name>`. |
| `type` | Download type. Currently `model` for server-owned jobs. |
| `model_name` | Lemonade model name associated with the job. |
| `status` | Current state: `downloading`, `paused`, `cancelled`, `completed`, or `error`. |
| `running` | Whether the download worker is still active. A terminal-looking status may still have `running=true` while the worker is releasing resources. |
| `file`, `file_index`, `total_files` | Current file progress within the download. |
| `bytes_downloaded`, `bytes_total`, `percent` | Current-file byte progress as reported by the downloader. |
| `total_download_size` | Total expected bytes across all files when known. |
| `bytes_previously_downloaded` | Bytes already present on disk for the current file when resuming or skipping existing data. |
| `completed_files_bytes` | Bytes from files completed before the current file. |
| `cumulative_bytes_downloaded`, `overall_bytes_downloaded` | Total bytes downloaded across the whole job. `overall_bytes_downloaded` is kept as a compatibility alias. |
| `complete` | `true` when the download completed successfully. |
| `error` | Error message, present only for failed jobs. |

## `POST /v1/downloads/control`
<sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-fully_available-green)</sub>

Control a server-owned model download job.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | Yes | Download id returned by `POST /v1/pull` or `GET /v1/downloads`, for example `model:Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-CPU`. |
| `action` | Yes | One of `pause`, `cancel`, or `remove`. |

### Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pause` | Requests the worker to stop and keeps the job visible as `paused`. The worker may briefly report `running=true` while it unwinds. |
| `cancel` | Requests the worker to stop and marks the job as `cancelled`. Clients should wait for `running=false` before deleting partial files. |
| `remove` | Removes a stopped job from the server registry. If the worker is still running, the server keeps the job visible and treats the request as a cancel request until the worker stops. |

### Example request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:13305/v1/downloads/control \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "model:Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-CPU",
    "action": "pause"
  }'
```

### Response format

For `pause` and `cancel`, the endpoint returns the latest job snapshot:

```json
{
  "id": "model:Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-CPU",
  "type": "model",
  "model_name": "Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-CPU",
  "status": "paused",
  "running": false,
  "file": "model.gguf",
  "file_index": 1,
  "total_files": 2,
  "bytes_downloaded": 1073741824,
  "bytes_total": 2684354560,
  "percent": 40,
  "complete": false
}
```

For `remove`, the endpoint returns:

```json
{"status":"ok"}
```

If the job is already missing and `action` is `remove`, the endpoint returns:

```json
{"status":"ok","missing":true}
```

## `GET /v1/pull/variants`
<sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-fully_available-green)</sub>

Inspect a Hugging Face GGUF repository and enumerate the variants (quantizations and sharded folder groups) available for installation. Used by the `lemonade pull <owner/repo>` CLI flow and by the desktop app's model search to auto-populate the install form. The endpoint reads only public Hugging Face metadata; if the `HF_TOKEN` environment variable is set on the server, it is forwarded as a bearer token to access gated repositories.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `checkpoint` | Yes | Hugging Face repo id, e.g. `unsloth/Qwen3-8B-GGUF`. Passed as a query string. |

Example request:

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:13305/v1/pull/variants?checkpoint=unsloth/Qwen3-8B-GGUF'
```

### Response

```json
{
  "checkpoint": "unsloth/Qwen3-8B-GGUF",
  "recipe": "llamacpp",
  "suggested_name": "Qwen3-8B-GGUF",
  "suggested_labels": ["vision"],
  "mmproj_files": ["mmproj-model-f16.gguf"],
  "variants": [
    {
      "name": "Q4_K_M",
      "primary_file": "Qwen3-8B-Q4_K_M.gguf",
      "files": ["Qwen3-8B-Q4_K_M.gguf"],
      "sharded": false,
      "size_bytes": 4920000000
    },
    {
      "name": "Q8_0",
      "primary_file": "Q8_0/Qwen3-8B-Q8_0-00001-of-00002.gguf",
      "files": ["Q8_0/Qwen3-8B-Q8_0-00001-of-00002.gguf", "Q8_0/Qwen3-8B-Q8_0-00002-of-00002.gguf"],
      "sharded": true,
      "size_bytes": 8500000000
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `checkpoint` | Echoed input. |
| `recipe` | Suggested recipe (always `llamacpp` today; future expansion may return other values). |
| `suggested_name` | Repo id stripped of the `owner/` prefix; suitable for use as the `user.<name>` model name. |
| `suggested_labels` | Inferred labels — `vision` if any `mmproj-*.gguf` files exist, plus `embeddings`/`reranking` if those substrings appear in the repo id. |
| `mmproj_files` | Bare filenames of `mmproj-*.gguf` files in the repo; the first one should be passed as `mmproj` to `/v1/pull` for vision models. |
| `variants[]` | Top quantizations for the repo, capped at 5. Each entry has `name` (e.g. `Q4_K_M`, `UD-Q4_K_XL`), `primary_file`, `files`, `sharded`, and `size_bytes` (from the HF `?blobs=true` listing). Ranked by frequency of use in `server_models.json` (`Q4_K_M`, `UD-Q4_K_XL`, `Q8_0`, `Q4_0` first, everything else sorted lexicographically). The CLI `lemonade pull` menu adds a free-text "Other" option for quants outside the top 5. |

### Error responses

| Status | Cause |
|--------|-------|
| 400 | `checkpoint` query parameter missing or malformed (must contain `/`). |
| 404 | Hugging Face returned 404 for the checkpoint. |
| 500 | Other transport or parsing failures; the response body contains an `error` message. |

## `POST /v1/delete`
<sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-fully_available-green)</sub>

Delete a model by removing it from local storage. If the model is currently loaded, it will be unloaded first.

> Note: deleting a collection (`recipe: "collection.omni"`) removes only the collection entry from `user_models.json`; its components stay on disk. Delete the components individually if you want to free their disk space.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `model_name` | Yes | [Lemonade Server model name](https://lemonade-server.ai/models.html) to delete. |

Example request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:13305/v1/delete \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model_name": "Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-CPU"
  }'
```

Response format:

```json
{
  "status":"success",
  "message":"Deleted model: Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-CPU"
}
```

In case of an error, the status will be `error` and the message will contain the error message.

## `POST /v1/load`
<sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-fully_available-green)</sub>

Explicitly load a registered model into memory. This is useful to ensure that the model is loaded before you make a request. Installs the model if necessary.

> Note: loading a collection (`recipe: "collection.omni"`) loads each of its components in turn. Per-model options like `ctx_size` or `llamacpp_backend` are not forwarded to components — set them on each component's own `recipe_options.json` entry instead.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Applies to | Description |
|-----------|----------|------------|-------------|
| `model_name` | Yes | All | [Lemonade Server model name](https://lemonade-server.ai/models.html) to load. |
| `save_options` | No | All | Boolean. If true, saves recipe options to `recipe_options.json`. Any previously stored value for `model_name` is replaced. |
| `ctx_size` | No | llamacpp, flm, ryzenai-llm | Context size for the model. Overrides the default value. |
| `llamacpp_backend` | No | llamacpp | LlamaCpp backend to use (`vulkan`, `rocm`, `metal` or `cpu`). |
| `llamacpp_args` | No | llamacpp | Custom arguments to pass to llama-server. The following are NOT allowed: `-m`, `--port`, `--ctx-size`, `-ngl`, `--jinja`, `--mmproj`, `--embeddings`, `--reranking`. |
| `whispercpp_backend` | No | whispercpp | WhisperCpp backend: `npu` or `cpu` on Windows; `cpu` or `vulkan` on Linux. Default is `npu` if supported. |
| `whispercpp_args` | No | whispercpp | Custom arguments to pass to whisper-server. The following are NOT allowed: `-m`, `--model`, `--port`. Example: `--convert`. |
| `steps` | No | sd-cpp | Number of inference steps for image generation. Default: 20. |
| `cfg_scale` | No | sd-cpp | Classifier-free guidance scale for image generation. Default: 7.0. |
| `width` | No | sd-cpp | Image width in pixels. Default: 512. |
| `height` | No | sd-cpp | Image height in pixels. Default: 512. |
| `merge_args` | No | All | Boolean. If true (default), `*_args` values from global config and per-model config are merged (per-model takes priority). If false, per-model `*_args` replace global `*_args` entirely. |

**Setting Priority:**

When loading a model, settings are applied in this priority order:
1. Values explicitly passed in the `load` request (highest priority)
2. Per-model values configurable in `recipe_options.json` (see below for details)
3. Values from environment variables or server startup arguments (see [Server Configuration](../guide/configuration/README.md))
4. Default hardcoded values in `lemond` (lowest priority)


### Per-model options

You can configure recipe-specific options on a per-model basis. Lemonade manages a file called `recipe_options.json` in the user's Lemonade cache (default: `~/.cache/lemonade`). The available options depend on the model's recipe:

```json
{
  "user.Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct": {
    "ctx_size": 16384,
    "llamacpp_backend": "vulkan",
    "llamacpp_args": "-np 2 -kvu"
  },
  "Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-GGUF" : {
    "llamacpp_backend": "rocm"
  },
  "whisper-large-v3-turbo-q8_0.bin": {
    "whispercpp_backend": "npu",
    "whispercpp_args": "--convert"
  }
}
```

Note that model names include any applicable prefix, such as `user.` and `extra.`.

### Example requests

## `POST /v1/install`
<sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-fully_available-green)</sub>

Install or update a backend for a specific recipe/backend pair. If the backend is already installed but outdated, this endpoint updates it to the configured version.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `recipe` | Yes | Recipe name (for example, `llamacpp`, `flm`, `whispercpp`, `sd-cpp`, `ryzenai-llm`) |
| `backend` | Yes | Backend name within the recipe (for example, `vulkan`, `rocm`, `cpu`, `default`) |
| `stream` | No | If `true`, returns Server-Sent Events with progress. Defaults to `false`. |
| `force` | No | If `true`, bypasses hardware filtering for `unsupported` backends and attempts installation anyway. Defaults to `false`. |

### Example request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:13305/v1/install \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "recipe": "llamacpp",
    "backend": "vulkan",
    "stream": false
  }'
```

### Response format

```json
{
  "status":"success",
  "recipe":"llamacpp",
  "backend":"vulkan"
}
```

In case of an error, returns an `error` field with details.

## `POST /v1/uninstall`
<sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-fully_available-green)</sub>

Uninstall a backend for a specific recipe/backend pair. If loaded models are using that backend, they are unloaded first.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `recipe` | Yes | Recipe name |
| `backend` | Yes | Backend name |

### Example request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:13305/v1/uninstall \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "recipe": "llamacpp",
    "backend": "vulkan"
  }'
```

### Response format

```json
{
  "status":"success",
  "recipe":"llamacpp",
  "backend":"vulkan"
}
```

In case of an error, returns an `error` field with details.

## Log Streaming API (WebSocket)
<sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-fully_available-green)</sub>

Stream server logs over WebSocket. Clients connect, send a subscribe message, and receive a snapshot of recent log history followed by live log entries as they occur.

### Connection

The WebSocket server shares the same port as the [Realtime Audio Transcription API](./openai.md#ws-realtime). Discover the port via the [`/v1/health`](#get-v1health) endpoint (`websocket_port` field), then connect:

```
ws://localhost:<websocket_port>/logs/stream
```

After connecting, send a `logs.subscribe` message to start receiving logs.

### Client → Server Messages

| Message Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `logs.subscribe` | Subscribe to log stream. Optional `after_seq` field to resume from a specific sequence number. |

### Server → Client Messages

| Message Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `logs.snapshot` | Initial batch of retained log entries (up to 5000). Sent once after subscribing. |
| `logs.entry` | A single live log entry. Sent as new log lines are emitted. |
| `error` | Error message (e.g., invalid subscribe request). |

### Example: Subscribe to Logs

Subscribe from the beginning (full backlog):

```json
{
  "type": "logs.subscribe",
  "after_seq": null
}
```

Resume after a known sequence number (e.g., on reconnect):

```json
{
  "type": "logs.subscribe",
  "after_seq": 1042
}
```

### Example: Snapshot Response

```json
{
  "type": "logs.snapshot",
  "entries": [
    {
      "seq": 1,
      "timestamp": "2025-03-30 14:22:01.123",
      "severity": "Info",
      "tag": "Server",
      "line": "2025-03-30 14:22:01.123 [Info] (Server) Starting Lemonade Server..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example: Live Entry

```json
{
  "type": "logs.entry",
  "entry": {
    "seq": 1043,
    "timestamp": "2025-03-30 14:22:05.456",
    "severity": "Info",
    "tag": "Router",
    "line": "2025-03-30 14:22:05.456 [Info] (Router) Model loaded successfully"
  }
}
```

### Log Entry Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `seq` | integer | Monotonically increasing sequence number. Use for dedup and resume. |
| `timestamp` | string | Formatted timestamp from the log system. |
| `severity` | string | Log level: `Trace`, `Debug`, `Info`, `Warning`, `Error`, `Fatal`. |
| `tag` | string | Log source tag (e.g., `Server`, `Router`, component name). |
| `line` | string | The full formatted log line. |

### Integration Notes

- **Reconnection**: Track the last `seq` received and pass it as `after_seq` on reconnect to avoid duplicate entries.
- **Backlog**: The server retains up to 5000 recent log entries. The snapshot may be smaller if fewer entries exist.
- **Platform availability**: WebSocket log streaming is available on all platforms (Windows, Linux, and macOS).

## `GET /live`
<sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-fully_available-green)</sub>

Lightweight liveness probe for load balancers and orchestrators. Unlike [`/v1/health`](#get-v1health), this endpoint does no work beyond confirming the process is up — it does not inspect loaded models or backends — so it is safe to poll at high frequency. `HEAD /live` is also supported and returns `200 OK` with an empty body.

Unlike the other endpoints on this page, `/live` is not versioned and is not mounted under the `/api/v0/`, `/api/v1/`, `/v0/`, `/v1/` prefixes.

### Example request

```bash
curl http://localhost:13305/live
```

### Response format

```json
{"status":"ok"}
```
