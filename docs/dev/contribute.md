# Contributing to Lemonade

We're excited that you are interested in contributing!

Please carefully review Lemonade's [philosophy](./philosophy.md) before making a pull request. As a contributor, you can anticipate the vast majority of reviewer feedback by aligning your design to the philosophy.

## Development Process

### Working Groups

Lemonade's roadmap is defined by a set of [working groups](./working-groups/README.md), and most substantial contributions should be within the scope of one of these groups. If you would like to participate, start by reading this document and then reach out to the working group lead in your subject of interest.

### Merging a Contribution

1. We highly recommend that all contributors join the [Lemonade discord community](https://discord.gg/5xXzkMu8Zk), meet [the maintainers](#maintainers) and get a sense of what is trending.
2. Depending on the complexity of your contribution:
    - Simple fixes: just make a PR.
    - Features: contact [a maintainer](#maintainers) who works in the area of your feature and get them to agree to review it before you start coding.
    - Architectural changes: write an issue explaining the justification and design and bring it to the Discord for debate.
3. Create a fork of Lemonade repo, implement your code, and then make a pull request to merge your code back to the main repo. Assign the reviewer(s) you discussed the change with.

### Picking a Project

Not sure what to work on? Come to the feature-requests and troubleshooting channels on the Discord and see what people need!

### Issues

Issues are a great way to document a bug or feature request. However, Lemonade is a community-driven project and you still need to find someone to implement your issue. It is highly recommended that you bring your issue to the [Lemonade discord community](https://discord.gg/5xXzkMu8Zk) and connect with a contributor who wants to implement it.

### Reviewer Expectation

Each contribution needs to:

1. Adhere to the [philosophy](./philosophy.md).
2. Pass the CI tests.
    - Contributors: make sure the code builds locally before creating the PR.
    - Reviewers: make sure to check the code *before* allowing CI to run!
3. Sustain the overall code quality and standards of the rest of the repo.

### AI Policy

Contributors are encouraged to use AI to code their project. However, please review your AI's code yourself before asking another human to review it.

Reviewers are expected to use tools like Claude Code's `/review` to save time by analyzing code quality and edge cases. If AI tools generate PR comments, please clearly identify which comments are AI-generated and which are authored by you.

__Please do not use AI to write issues__. If you feel an issue is important enough for a human to read it then please take the time to write it yourself.

## Maintainers

While each maintainer is welcome to work on any part of the Lemonade codebase, each maintainer does have specific knowledge of certain areas. You should use their knowledge as a starting point for designing your contribution, and they will be the ones to review your contribution when it is ready.
